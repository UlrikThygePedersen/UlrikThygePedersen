## About Me
As a **Senior Data Scientist**, I thrive at the intersection of cutting-edge machine learning, artificial intelligence, and statistics. Whether it's solving complex business problems or developing **agentic frameworks for language models (LLMs)**, my focus is on transforming data into actionable insights.

With a background in **biophysics** and data science, I've led a diverse range of projects, from **automating processes with AI** to **optimizing supply chain operations**. Currently, I’m applying these skills at **NTT Data**, where I also mentor the next generation of data scientists.

## What I Do

### **Machine Learning & AI** 🧠  
My main focus is on building and deploying **machine learning** and **AI solutions** that deliver tangible business impact. From creating predictive models that drive smarter decision-making to deploying AI systems into production, I cover the entire lifecycle of AI development to ensure real-world success.

**Key Applications:**
- Predictive modeling for business insights
- Deep learning frameworks for computer vision and NLP tasks
- End-to-end AI pipelines, from data processing to model deployment

---

### **Bayesian Statistics** 📊  
I utilize **Bayesian statistics** to develop models that are more interpretable and better suited for decision-making under uncertainty. These methods allow for a more robust approach when dealing with incomplete data or when integrating prior knowledge into machine learning models.

**Key Applications:**
- Probabilistic models for uncertain environments
- Bayesian inference to improve predictions and decision-making

---

### **Agentic Frameworks for LLMs** 🤖  
I’m also exploring the development of **agent-based frameworks** for **large language models (LLMs)**. These frameworks extend the capabilities of LLMs, allowing them to autonomously handle workflows such as customer service automation or decision support.

**Key Applications:**
- Autonomous agents for process automation
- LLM-based conversational agents for task execution
